                            Merge Sort is a widely-used, efficient, and stable comparison-based sorting algorithm.
                            It follows the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or list of elements.
                            The algorithm recursively divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists until each
                            sublist consists of only one element, which is inherently sorted. Then, it merges these
                            sorted sublists back together, combining them in a way that maintains the overall sorted
                            order.
                            Merge Sort's time complexity is O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large datasets.
                            It is known
                            for its consistent performance and is often used as a benchmark for other sorting
                            algorithms.

                            Bubble Sort is a straightforward and elementary sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps
                            through the list of elements,
                            compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass-through is
                            repeated until no swaps are
                            needed, indicating that the list is sorted. However, Bubble Sort is generally not the most
                            efficient sorting algorithm,
                            as its time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, making it less practical
                            for large datasets.
                            Nonetheless, it is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for educational
                            purposes and for small lists
                            where efficiency is not a primary concern.

                            Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum
                            element from the unsorted
                            portion of an array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is
                            repeated until the entire array is
                            sorted. Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, which
                            makes it less efficient
                            than some other sorting algorithms for large datasets. However, it has the advantage of
                            requiring only a small number of
                            swaps, making it useful in situations where minimizing the number of swaps is important.
                            While not the most efficient
                            choice for large datasets, Selection Sort is easy to understand and implement, making it
                            suitable for educational
                            purposes and small arrays.
